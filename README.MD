# Acorn Game 

## Backgroud
This assignmment is desighed to help students to bring Python to to practice, which I have write in the first semester in 2020 in the University of Sydney.
You can play this game in your terminal(Both windows and linux, also in the terminal of Pycharm). The Acorn(player) will go to the end cell through many mysterous troubles, like the Fire and the Teleport. The teleport will transport the acorn to the another teleport, the fire then maybe burn the acron to die.
If you can have a look at my code , you will know how to achieve all the functions by using object oriented programming by Python,which will assessed in our courese.  In this game, you can use "a" in the keyboard to represent the left direction,"d" to the right and so on. input "q" means you want to quit this game ,input "e" means you want to wait a turn to move.
